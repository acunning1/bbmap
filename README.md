## Usage

## Assumptions
- Exercise permits use of math lib for weighted average calculation
- Weighted average uses households as weights rather than population
- User is familiar enough with cli input to encapsulate states with whitespaces in quotations, i.e. 'new york'
- Weighted average should be displayed as a percentage float, rather than 0 integer
- Additional text regarding output to improve usability is okay
